    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
        This policy applies to both the MindWarrior Telegram bot and the MindWarrior Android app.
        We take your privacy seriously and aim to collect as little data as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
        Your <a href="/faq.<?=$LANG;?>.<?=$ext;?>#formula">“Formula of firm resolution”</a>
        stays on your device and is not sent to our servers. For the Telegram bot, it is stored locally in
        <a href="https://davitdvalashvili1996.medium.com/local-storage-in-javascript-f7aad374980e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">localStorage</a>
        inside Telegram’s
        <a href="https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/telegram-apps/testing-apps#debug-mode-for-mini-apps" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WebView</a>.
        For the Android app, it is stored locally in the app's private storage on your device.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of this, we recommend you to regularly create manual backup copies of your Formula by copy-pasting its content
        to some secure place (e.g. Telegram's <a href="https://telegram.org/blog/new-saved-messages-and-9-more" target="_blank">
            Saved Messages</a>).
    </p>

        <li>restore progress within the app on your device</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Storage</h3>
    <h4>Telegram bot</h4>
    <p>We store your data securely and take appropriate measures to protect it from unauthorized access,
        disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</p>

    <p><strong>Hosting:</strong> We use third-party hosting providers, and your data may be stored or processed in different countries/jurisdictions. We take reasonable steps to protect it, but cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h4>Android app</h4>
    <p>
        The Android app stores data locally in the app's private storage on your device. You can remove this data
        by clearing the app's storage or uninstalling the app.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Rights</h3>
    <h4>Telegram bot</h4>
    <p>You have the following controls regarding your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access</strong>: You can access all you data anytime by using
            <span class="code-highlight">/data</span> command. That will
            return all your raw data that the game stores about you on its server.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion</strong>: You can delete your data at any time by using
            <span class="code-highlight">/data</span> bot command and then clicking "Delete" button.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Please make sure to also clear the chat history with the game bot as it is stored outside of our control
                    somewhere in Telegram, although it won't guarantee the complete deletion of your data as we don't
                    know how Telegram handles it. Please check "Using Telegram" section below for more information.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Deletion takes effect immediately for active systems where practical, but backups/logs may persist for a limited time.

        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Using Telegram</h3>

    <p>
        The project is implemented as a bot in Telegram. Because of that, you should also check Telegram's own
        <a href="https://telegram.org/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a> to understand how it will treat your
        data. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of Telegram and don't have any visibility or control
        over them. Please make sure that you are comfortable with that before using the game.
    </p>

    <h3>Using Google Play</h3>
    <p>
        The Android app is distributed via Google Play. Google may collect data associated with installation and
        updates according to its own
        <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">privacy policy</a>.
        We do not receive personal data from Google Play.
    </p>
