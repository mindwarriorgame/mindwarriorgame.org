    <h3>What is the purpose of the game?</h3>
    <p>
        "MindWarrior" game was created to help with your personal growth and development.
        To achieve that, it keeps you focused on your dreams and aspirations.
        The main concept of the game – ✍️<a href="#letter"><i>Letter to Yourself</i></a> – is your private inspirational message
        that you write for yourself and then review it regularly during the day.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each time you 💫 review the <i>Letter</i>, your thoughts are brought back to what is really important to you.
        This routine will help to keep your mind clear and focused, pulling you away from the dullness of everyday life's noise and distractions.
    </p>

    <h3>What should I write in my Letter?</h3>

    <p>
        <i>"Letter to yourself"</i> is a private freeform text message, where you can
        express anything that is meaningful to you. It could be your favorite quotes, mantras, reminders, wise thoughts
        and observations, or anything else, you are the one to decide! The only guidance is that it
        should motivate you towards personal growth and development.
    </p>
    <p>
        A strong <i>Letter</i> <a href="#review">will keep you focused, motivated, and disciplined</a>. It must support you on your life journey and help
        staying engaged
        and committed. If you find yourself receiving constant reminders from the game about missed reviews, or you are thinking of quitting the game,
        it might be a sign that your <i>Letter</i> requires a revision.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-review" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens when I review my Letter?</h3>

    <p>
        Spiritually, when you review your <i>Letter</i> with 💫 <span class="pre">/review</span> command, it
        brings your mind back to what truly matters, pulling you away from distractions and nonsense
        of everyday life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Game-wise, when you perform the review without being reminded about that,
        you earn one game point 📈.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="/images/faq_en/review_plus_score.png" class="image-link" target="_blank>"><img src="/images/faq_en/review_plus_score.png" alt="Review plus score" title="Review plus score" width="400" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        You could use 📊 <span class="pre">/stats</span> command to see the details about your game progress.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="/images/faq_en/stats.png" class="image-link" target="_blank>"><img src="/images/faq_en/stats.png" alt="Stats" title="Stats" width="400" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can review your <i>Letter</i> as often as you'd like, however only the reviews performed at least
        5 minutes apart from each other will be rewarded ("cool-down" rule).
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-forgot" class="faq-item">
    <h3>What happens if I forget to review my Letter?</h3>

    <p>
        If you forget to review your <i>Letter</i> in time, the game will remind you with a message,
        but you will lose a gaming score 📉.
    </p>

    <p>
        <a href="/images/faq_en/review_minus_score.png" class="image-link" target="_blank>"><img src="/images/faq_en/review_minus_score.png" alt="Review minus score" title="Review minus score" width="400" /></a>
    </p>

    <p>
        For the first missed review, you will lose only 3 points (lenient mode), however for each consequent
        miss you will be penalized in full
        with 6 points, until you finish the review.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="smooth-difficulty" class="faq-item">
    <h3>How often do I need to review my Letter?</h3>

    <p>
        The frequency of reviews is determined by the difficulty level of the game. The default
        level is "Easy", which could be changed at any time by 💪 <span class="pre">/difficulty</span> command.
    </p>

    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Beginner</td>
            <td>once per 2 hours</td>

    <p>
        To take a break, simply pause the game with ⏸️ <span class="pre">/pause</span> command.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the pause, you won't receive any notifications or lose any gaming scores.
        The active play time counter won't be counting, too.
    </p>

    <p>
        To resume the game, simply review your <i>Letter</i> as usually with
        💫 <span class="pre">/review</span> command.

        "Mind" part is about "inner self" and personal thoughts.
        To make a change in life, first one needs to make a change in their mind.

    <p>
        "Warrior" part is about action and persistent effort. The change doesn't happen magically by itself.
        Also, the outcome of any action affects not only your life, but everyone around as well.

        We (the creators of the game) strongly believe that everyone could make a difference in the world.
        By changing ourselves, we contribute in making the world a better place.
        Becoming better versions of ourselves leads us to better decisions, which result in better actions and
        outcomes for everyone to enjoy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, every time you review your <a href="#letter"><i>Letter to yourself</i></a>, you're not only improving your life,
        but also making the world a better place for everyone! 🙌

<div id="smooth-letter-example" class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I see Letters of other players?</h3>

    <p>
        "MindWarrior" game takes privacy of the players very seriously.
        Your <i>Letter</i> is stored locally on your device and
        the game never copies or sends it to its servers.
        Therefore, it is physically impossible to see a <i>Letter</i> of a
        random player simply because the game doesn't have access to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The good news is that <strong>some players share their <i>Letters</i> voluntarily
            on our website</strong>, which could be found
        on "<a href="https://mindwarriorgame.org/shared-letters">Shared Letters</a>" page.
        Please feel free to check it out!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you'd like to help inspiring other players and share your own <i>Letter</i>, please follow
        <a href="https://github.com/mindwarriorgame/shared-letters/blob/main/README.md" target="_blank">these instructions</a>.
    </p>
</div>




<div id="smooth-share" class="faq-item">
    <h3>Can I share my letter with others players?</h3>

    <p>
        Yes! The game is an open source project, and you are welcome to contribute to it by
        sharing your <i>Letter</i> with others. It will become a part of project's website and will be published
        at "<a href="https://mindwarriorgame.org/shared-letters">Shared Letters</a>" page.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please refer to <a href="#letter-example">the question above</a> for more details.
    </p>

</div>

<div id="smooth-privacy" class="faq-item">
    <h3>Who could see my Letter?</h3>

    <p>
        We respect your privacy. The game stores your <i>Letter</i> locally on your device and never copies
        or sends it to its servers.
        Please check our <a href="/privacy.en.<?=getenv('LINK_EXT');?>" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for more details.
    </p>

    <p>
        Because of the above, it is very important to store a private copy (backup) of your <i>Letter</i> elsewhere
        (e.g. in "<a href="https://telegram.org/blog/new-saved-messages-and-9-more" target="_blank">Saved Messages</a>" on Telegram).
        This backup copy will help you to restore your <i>Letter</i> in case of some unforeseeable event (such as losing
        your device, or accidentally reinstalling Telegram app). Otherwise, it would be lost forever.
